# GGMUrevisedstandard
One of my mini-hobby projects  creating a Man Utd  soccer website

Changes that I included in my form prototype.
Swipe Integration:
Properly placed the form inside a swiper-slide to integrate seamlessly with the swipe layout.
Updated the swipe library configuration to include the form as part of the slides.

JavaScript Enhancements:
Added event listeners to ensure the form slide loads dynamically during navigation.
Fixed conflicts affecting the swipe navigation to the form slide.
